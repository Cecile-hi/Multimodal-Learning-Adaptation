Ses02M_script01_3_M030.mp4 [split|sign] I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean? [split|sign] Sad
Ses04M_script03_1_M013.mp4 [split|sign] All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light. [split|sign] Angry
Ses05M_script01_1b_M003.mp4 [split|sign] I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen. [split|sign] Sad

Ses02F_script03_2_M009.mp4 [split|sign] Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy? [split|sign] Neutral
Ses04M_impro06_M012.mp4 [split|sign] I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people - [split|sign] Sad
Ses01M_impro05_F031.mp4 [split|sign] I wish I- [split|sign] Neutral

Ses02M_script02_1_M028.mp4 [split|sign] Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs [split|sign] Happy
Ses02F_impro05_F001.mp4 [split|sign] No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that? [split|sign] Neutral
